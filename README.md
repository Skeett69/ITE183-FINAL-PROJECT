Here's a guide to set up the PHP native system for the Job Portal Website:

### Prerequisites
1. **Install XAMPP**: Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), which includes Apache and MySQL.
2. **Install Composer**: Download and install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to manage PHP dependencies.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your `htdocs` directory in XAMPP (usually located in `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows).
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ITE183-2024-2025/JOB-PORTAL-WEBSITE.git
     ```

2. **Configure Virtual Host**
   - Open the Apache configuration file for virtual hosts, usually found in `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf`.
   - Add the following configuration:
     ```apache
     <VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
         DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/JOB-PORTAL-WEBSITE"
         ServerName job-portal.local
         <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/JOB-PORTAL-WEBSITE">
             Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
             AllowOverride All
             Require all granted
         </Directory>
     </VirtualHost>
     ```

3. **Update Hosts File**
   - Open your hosts file (usually at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).
   - Add this entry to point `job-portal.local` to localhost:
     ```
     127.0.0.1 job-portal.local
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd C:/xampp/htdocs/JOB-PORTAL-WEBSITE
     ```
   - Install PHP dependencies using Composer:
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

Here’s the updated setup instruction for configuring the environment:

5. **Configure Environment and Database**
   - In the project directory, duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor and input your local database credentials:
     ```plaintext
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_NAME=your_database_name
     DB_USER=your_database_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
     ```
   - Save the file after entering your database details.

--- 

This ensures you’re setting up your local environment configuration correctly with the cloned `.env` file.

6. **Run the Application**
   - Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel
   - In your browser, go to [http://job-portal.local](http://job-portal.local) to access the application.
   
   **Alternative (Simple Setup)**:
   - If you don't want to configure virtual hosts, you can simply access: [http://localhost/JOB-PORTAL-WEBSITE/public](http://localhost/JOB-PORTAL-WEBSITE/public)

### Additional Steps
- **Permissions**: Ensure appropriate read/write permissions on necessary folders if required.
- **Environment Configuration**: Adjust any specific environment variables needed for the application in the `.env` file if provided.

This setup should get your Job Portal Website up and running! Let me know if you need any further customization or troubleshooting.
